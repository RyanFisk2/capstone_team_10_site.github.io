## Capstone Team 10
### Project Description

* RVTrippy is a webapp that acts as a one stop shop for RV trip planning. Existing tools for RV trip planning and itineraries

have a lack of tools and aggregation of those tools to fully plan out an RV trip on one site. Users typically have to juggle

multiple web pages at the same time in order to get RV campground information, accessibility, ratings of relevant campgrounds,

and finally a way for users to store their trips for planning future adventures. RVTrippy aims to provide all of these resources, and more,

in one central location.


* Along with the above features, RVTrippy intends to allow users to share their trips with others and engage with the greater RV community, along 

with the tools to make the trip planning process more enjoyable. RVTrippy will allow users to add friends, share trips with them, and look at trips

that similar users have taken. Combining these features with a simple and convenient interface for users to plan out their trip will hopefully make 

RVTrippy the predominant one stop shop for RV trip planners.
